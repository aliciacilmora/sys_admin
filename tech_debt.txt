why do you need to know about tech debt?
- it is an issue that is probably costing the company you work for money
- you need to always have it at back of your mind -- your peers will respect you and you will have less 'nightmare projects'
- it's a good interview question to find out how senior a candidate is

 what is tech debt?
- stuff that needs to be paid back (worked off) later
things that cost you time and energy while they exist, and make other things more expensive (intersest).

    . undocumented code
    . projects that are missing a component (security, automation, configuration management, repeatibility)
    . special snowflake servers
    . things no one understands anymore

 where it costs you?
    . adding features
    . maintenance
    . training
    . estimates
 technical debt costs time and energy, and increases complexity and risk

 how does technical debt start?
- sometimes it's worth it. sometimes it ruins you.
    . we promised this to a client by the end of the week
    . we dont have time to do it correctly now -- we will fix it up later
    . it just needs to work
    . the customer isn't paying for us to document everything in detail right now

 how to pay off technical debt
    . create tickets/projects for repayment when you decide to do things which create techniacal debt
    . one day per week dedicated to paying back tech debt
    . learn how to communicate to your managers and business people about it
    . manage your managers if they dont see it as a real problem stop offering up potential solutions that will make it worse
    . stop being optimistic with your estimates
